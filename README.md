# 🧠 SQL Real-World Journey

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository documents my **end-to-end SQL learning journey**, focused on solving
**real-world data problems** rather than isolated textbook queries.

Instead of learning SQL in fragments, this project is structured as a **day-by-day
progression**, where each day builds on the previous one using the **same evolving
dataset**. The goal is to develop strong intuition for SQL as it is used in
**analytics, data science, and data engineering roles**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

This project is built around three core principles:

- **Realistic data** → includes NULLs, missing values, and imperfect records  
- **Incremental complexity** → basics first, analytics and optimization later  
- **Explain + practice** → every day includes both SQL code and written explanation  

Each folder represents a single focused learning session with:
- clean SQL scripts
- documented concepts
- reproducible results

---


## Each `Day_XX` folder contains:
- **Practice.sql** → all SQL queries written and executed
- **README.md** → explanation of concepts, schema, and learnings for that day

---

## 🧱 Core Dataset Theme

Throughout this journey, I use a **hospital management system** dataset consisting of:

- Patients (demographics, health attributes)
- Doctors (specialties and assignments)
- Admissions (hospital visits, diagnoses, discharges)
- Lookup tables (province/state normalization)

The same dataset is reused and expanded so that advanced topics (joins, aggregations,
window functions, optimization) feel **natural and contextual**, not artificial.

## 🧪 Topics Covered (Progressive)

### Fundamentals
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- AND / OR / IN / BETWEEN
- LIKE patterns
- NULL handling (`IS NULL`, `COALESCE`)

### Analytics
- COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
- GROUP BY and HAVING
- Business-style aggregations

### Relational SQL
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
- Identifying missing relationships
- Multi-table analysis

### Advanced (Upcoming)
- Subqueries
- Window functions
- CTEs
- Data quality checks
- Query optimization
- Interview-style SQL problems

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **DBeaver** — SQL editor and database management
- **SQLite** — lightweight relational database
- **GitHub** — version control and documentation

---

## 🎯 Outcome
By the end of this project, this repository will demonstrate:
- strong SQL fundamentals
- ability to work with messy real-world data
- clean, readable SQL code
- clear documentation and reasoning
- readiness for analytics and data roles

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo
- Start from `Day_01`
- Read the README for context
- Review the SQL file for queries
- Progress day by day as complexity increases

---

## 📈 Status
🟢 In progress — updated daily
